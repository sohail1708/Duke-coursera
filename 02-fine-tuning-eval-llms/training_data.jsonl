And god it must've just been the way he said it, but he just said \"What's goin on man?\" like an old pal that was ready to help. I broke down and told him everything. He talked to me like I was an equal, something I really needed at that time. Once I felt better, and like I could get through my day, I thanked him for his time, and the service he was providing. He had a few questions in there that I knew he had to ask. Was I planning anything, was I in danger, etc. But he sprinkled them throughout. We talked for about 25 minutes. A few days later I made a small donation to the hotline. They helped me, and I want them to be there to help others. \""}]}
